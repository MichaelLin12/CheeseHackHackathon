# Local Goods Distribution 

With COVID 19, many people lost their jobs and don't have enough money to get Food
so we decided to create a website to advertise local food distributions for those in need

Our website includes:
a Map with locations of food distributions 

a Table with list of organizations that distribute food.
the table also includes their address, date and time of food distribution, the address at which food 
delivery will happen at,
the type of food being delivered, and the organizations phone number.

Organizations will also have the ability to add themselves to the list if they are not there and 
add new food categories. They will also have the ability to remove themselves from the list when they
are done distributing food.
