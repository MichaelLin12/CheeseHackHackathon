With COVID 19, many people lost their jobs and don't have enough money to get Food
so we decided to create a website to advertise local food distributions for those in need




Features of the website consist of:
Table with list of organizations that distribute food
the table consist of the organizations name, address, date and time of food distribution, the kind of food, and the organizations phone number
people can click on the organizations and they can see where the organization is located on a Map
An organization can choose to advertise themselves on the table if not already listed
Then the organization can delist themselves once they are done distributing food
